### Description

The following example demonstrates how to create a project from scratch, using a dockerized `Airflow` project, an S3
Bucket and a MongoDB Connection.

In this example we will demonstrate how to use `airgoodies` to quickly set up a workflow that will load a `.csv` file
from our S3 Bucket, filters its data to extract what we need and afterward save the result into a MongoDB
table.

You can find the source code for this
example [here](https://github.com/stav121/apache-airflow-goodies-examples/tree/main/examples/load_csv_from_s3_to_mongo)

### Prerequisites

In order to execute the following example locally, we need to have:

* a valid `Docker` installation
* a `docker-compose` installation
* an `Amazon S3` bucket

### Basic setup

The basic setup of the project, begins with the structure:

We create a new project directory:

```bash
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
```

In this project we need to create the folder structure as shown bellow:

```text
my_project/
    \__ Dockerfile
    \__ docker-compose.yaml
    \__ requirements.txt
    \__ dags/
            \__ __init__.py
            \__ my_dag.py
                \__ custom
                    __init__.py
                    transform.py
```

To generate this structure we run the following command:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
touch docker-compose.yaml
touch requirements.txt
mkdir dags/
cd dags
touch __init__.py
touch my_dag.py
mkdir custom
cd custom
touch __init__.py
touch transform.py
```

### Create the Dockerfile

Inside the Dockerfile we paste the following:

```dockerfile
# Custom image for Airflow 2.7.2 and Python version 3.11
FROM apache/airflow:2.7.2-python3.11

COPY requirements.txt .

# Upgrade PIP
RUN pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the requirements for local dev
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will create an `Apache Airflow v2.7.2` with `Python 3.11`, next open our `docker-compose.yaml`
and paste the content from
the [example's code](https://github.com/stav121/apache-airflow-goodies-examples/blob/main/examples/load_csv_from_s3_to_mongo/docker-compose.yaml).

This will create a full `Airflow` deployment locally with an associated `MongoDB` for our example.

### Create the `requiements.txt`

Before starting anything on `docker` we need to install our requirements.

For that, we open our `requirements.txt` and insert the following:

```requirements.txt
# Add the requirement for `airgoodies`
airgoodies==0.0.5
```

### Starting the instance

Now, all we have to do is build and start our `airflow` deployment:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

After a while, we can navigate to `http://localhost:8080`, use `username: airflow` and `password: airflow` to view the
console.

### Setting up the environment

The first step we need to do is to configure the variables used by the `DAG`, and specifically
used by the `airgoodies` modules that we are going to user.

We navigate to the [Apache Airflow -> Admin -> Variables](http://localhost:8080/variable/list/) page, and
select the `Choose file` option, and insert the following file (`airgoodies-variables.json`):

```json
{
  "csv_loader.airgoodies-mongo-db-connection-url": "mongodb://root:root@mongo:27017",
  "csv_loader.airgoodies-mongo-db-name": "data",
  "csv_loader.airgoodies-aws-s3-connection-name": "s3_conn",
  "csv_loader.airgoodies-aws-s3-default-bucket": "<s3-bucket-name>",
  "csv_loader.airgoodies-dag-config-file-key": "csv_loader_dag_config.yaml",
  "csv_loader.airgoodies-task-aws-load-from-s3-to-mongo-input-file-variable": "input_file"
}
```

(Replace the `<s3-bucket-name>` with the name of your S3 Bucket selected for the example).

And afterwards select the `Import Variable` option, to insert the Variables into our Airflow instance.

Next step is to create the S3 connection defined in the `csv_loader.airgoodies-aws-s3-connection-name` variable.

We simply navigate to [Apache Airflow -> Admin -> Connections -> New Connection](http://localhost:8080/connection/add)
and create
connection as such:

![](img/s3_conn.png)

And insert the `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key` to allow `Airflow` to access S3 resources, and
select `Save`

### Creating the DAG

In order to create a `DAG` we copy the following code into `dags/csv_loader.py`

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from airgoodies.command.parser import CommandParser
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

with DAG(
        dag_id='csv_loader',  # used as prefix for all variables in `airgoodies-variables.json`
        schedule_interval=None,
        start_date=days_ago(2),
        default_args={
            'owner': 'airflow'
        },
        catchup=False,
        tags=['csv_loader', 'aws', 'mongo', 'airgoodies:examples'],
) as dag:
    # Get the logger
    import logging

    logger: logging.getLogger = logging.getLogger('airflow.task')

    # Initialize the command parser
    command_parser: CommandParser = CommandParser(dag=dag)

    tasks: [PythonOperator] = []

    # Parse the commands from the `csv_loader_dag_config.yaml` in S3
    for _task in command_parser.get_commands():
        tasks = tasks >> _task.to_operator(dag=dag)

    tasks
```

This snippet of code, basically initializes a DAG and uses the fundamental `airgoodies` utility,
`CommandParser` which will dynamically create our tasks from the `YAML` find that we will create in the next step.

### Creating the configuration file (`csv_loader_dag_config.yaml`)

Now, as we said earlier, `airgoodies` has the ability to dynamically generate our tasks, by using a YAML file,
instead of Python code.

In our case, we want to load a file from S3, parse it and save it to our MongoDB. For this, `airgoodies` already
provides a pre-defined task
that can handle all the boilerplate functionality,
called [load-from-s3-to-mongo-table](../../features/tasks/s3/load_from_s3_to_mongo_table.md).

Based on the above documentation, we need to crete a new file, let's name it `csv_loader_dag_config.yaml` as we
specified in our
task Variable `csv_loader.airgoodies-dag-config-file-key`, and insert the configuration:

```yaml
load_from_s3_and_save: # This will appear as our task_id in airflow
  airgoodies_task: load_from_s3_to_mongo_table # The airgoodies pre-defined task name
  config: # The configuration of the task
    custom_transform_method: custom.transform.keep_athens # Use our custom transform method
    output_table_name: my_output_table # The name of the collection to save the result into
```

Save and upload in our `S3 Bucket`.

### Creating the input data (`population.csv`)

Next step, is to create the data of the demo, simply create a new file `population.csv` and insert the following data:

```csv
city,population,year
Athens,3153000,2021
Athens,3154000,2022
Patras,215922,2021
Patras,213984,2011
```

Save, and upload on the S3 bucket as well.

### Executing and troubleshooting

If everything is set up correctly up until now, we should be able to see a new `DAG` inside our `Airflow` home page:

![](img/dag.png)

On the far right corner we select to `Trigger DAG /w config`:

![](img/trigger.png)

And insert the following configuration and select `Trigger`:

```json
{
  "input_file": "population.png"
}
```

After waiting a bit, we will notice that our is failing with the following message:

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/operators/python.py", line 192, in execute
    return_value = self.execute_callable()
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/operators/python.py", line 209, in execute_callable
    return self.python_callable(*self.op_args, **self.op_kwargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airgoodies/task/aws_tasks.py", line 65, in load_from_s3_to_mongo_table
    transform_method: Callable[[DataFrame], DataFrame] = getattr(
                                                         ^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: module 'custom.transform' has no attribute 'keep_athens'
```

The above message is expected because we have defined a method `custom.transform.keep_athens` as
our `custom_transform_method` but we have not created it yet.

To remove this message, we need to edit our `dags/custom/transform.py` and add the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import logging


def keep_athens(data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Function that loads the pandas DataFrame and removes the lines that are not
    related to Athens.
    """
    logger: logging.Logger = logging.Logger('airflow.task')
    logger.info('Running custom transform method: keep_athens')

    # Remove each line not related to 'Athens'
    data.drop(data[data['city'] != 'Athens'].index, inplace=True)

    logger.info(f'New data:\n{data}')
    return data  # Return the DataFrame to write it in MongoDB
```

Save, wait a bit and re-execute the example. Now everythign should execute correctly:

![](img/success.png)

To verify the resource, we need to log in to our MongoDB (`mongodb://root:root@mongo:27017`) and verify the saved result
of our table `my_output_table` in `data` schema.

The result should look like this:

### Conclusion

This example demonstrates just a short example of the abilities of `airgoodies`, and it was created using
the `airgoodies` version [v0.0.5](https://github.com/stav121/apache-airflow-goodies/releases/tag/v0.0.5)
